# htmlify.p overview

For syntax highlighting, needs node.js installed.
Please run `make init-highlights` to automatically pull in the highlighting
grammar and build the highlighter.

For doc.perl6.org, the build process goes like this:
a cron job on hack.p6c.org as user 'doc.perl6.org' triggers the rebuild.

    */5 * * * * flock -n ~/update.lock -c ./doc/util/update-and-sync > update.log 2>&1

`util/update-and-sync` is under version control in the perl6/doc repo (same as
this file), and it first updates the git repository. If something changed, it
runs `htmlify.p6`, captures the output, and on success, syncs both the generated
files and the logs. In case of failure, only the logs are synchronized.

The build logs are available at https://docs.perl6.org/build-log/
